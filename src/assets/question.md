How would I load a .md markdown file into a react component? I have tried so many npm libraries through google searches and I cant find a good solution.

I want to load the .md file something like:
```
import HiThere from './../hithere.js';

render() {
    <div>
        <MarkDown src="about.md" />
    </div>
}
```
