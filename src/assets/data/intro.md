Hey Pete! I actually made a library that might be what you're looking for called nickchen-dev.
You can install it using the Nick Package Manager, or npm for short like so:
```
npm install --save nickchen-dev
```
Once you're finished installing the dependency just do this:
```
import { RockStarDev } from 'nickchen-dev';
import { FullstackPosition } from './mycompany/';

export default FullstackRole = ({requirements}) => {
    const quality_code = RockStarDev.developSomethingCool(requirements);

    return (
        <FullstackPosition
            fast_learner={true}
            team_player={true}
            animal_lover={true}
            is_funny={Math.random() > 0.99} >
            {quality_code}
        </FullstackPosition>
    );
}
```
and you're all set!
